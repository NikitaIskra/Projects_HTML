        <h1>WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h1>
        <p class="lorem-text">LOREM IPSUM IS SIMPLY DUMMY TEXT OF THE PRINTING AND TYPESETTING INDUSTRY, LOREM IPSUM HAS<br> BEEN THE INDUSTRY'S STANDARD DUMMY TEXT EVER SINCE THE 1500S, WHEN AN UNKNOWN PRINTER<br> TOOK A GALLEY OF TYPE AND SCRAMBLED IT TO MAKE A TYPE SPECIMEN BOOK. IT HAS SURVIVED NOT<br> ONLY FIVE CENTURIES, BUT ALSO THE LEAP INTO ELECTRONIC TYPESETTING, REMAINING ESSENTIALLY<br> UNCHANGED. IT WAS POPULARISED IN THE 1960S WITH THE RELEASE OF LETRASET SHEETS CONTAINING<br> LOREM IPSUM PASSAGES, AND MORE RECENTLY WITH DESKTOP PUBLISHING SOFTWARE LIKE ALDUS<br> PAGEMAKER INCLUDING VERSIONS OF LOREM IPSUM</p>
        <h1>WHY DO WE USE IT?</h1>
        <p class="lorem-text">IT IS A LONG ESTABLISHED FACT THAT A READER WILL BE DISTRACTED BY THE READABLE CONTENT OF A<br> PAGE WHEN LOOKING AT ITS LAYOUT THE POINT OF USING LOREM IPSUM IS THAT IT HAS A MORE-OR-LESS<br> NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF LETTERS, AS OPPOSED TO USING CONTENT HERE, CONTENT HERE, MAKING IT<br> LOOK LIKE READABLE ENGLISH MANY DESKTOP PUBLISHING PACKAGES AND WEB PAGE EDITORS NOW USE<br> LOREM IPSUM AS THEIR DEFAULT MODEL TEXT, AND A SEARCH FOR LOREM IPSUM WILL UNCOVER MANY<br> WEB SITES STILL IN THEIR INFANCY, VARIOUS VERSIONS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS, SOMETIMES BY<br> ACCIDENT, SOMETIMES ON PURPOSE (INJECTED HUMOUR AND THE LIKE)</p>
        <h1>WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?</h1>
        <p class="lorem-text">CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, LOREM IPSUM IS NOT SIMPLY KANDOM TEXT IT HAS ROOTS IN A PIECE OF<br> CLASSICAL LATIN LITERATURE FROM 45 BC, MAKING IT OVER 2000 YEARS OLD RICHARD MCCLINTOCK, A<br> LATIN PROFESSOR AT HAMPDEN-SYDNEY COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA, LOOKED UP ONE OF THE MORE OBSCURE<br> LATIN WORDS, CONSECTETUR FROM A LOREM IPSUM PASSAGE AND GOING THROUGH THE CITES OF THE<br> WORD IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE DISCOVERED THE UNDOUBTABLE SOURCE, LOREM IPSUM COMES FROM<br>SECTIONS 1.10.32 AND 1.10.33 OF "DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM (THE EXTREMES OF GOOD AND<br> EVIL) BY CICERO, WRITTEN IN 45 BC.

RACKHAM.</p>
         <h1>WHERE CAN I GET SOME?</h1>
         <p class="lorem-text">THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS OF PASSAGES OF LOREM IPSUM AVAILABLE, BUT THE MAJORITY HAVE<br> SUFFERED ALTERATION IN SOME FORM, BY INJECTED HUMOUR, OR RANDOMISED WORDS WHICH DON'T<br> LOOK EVEN SLIGHTLY BELIEVABLE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A PASSAGE OF LOREM IPSUM, YOU NEED TO BE<br> SURE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING EMBARRASSING HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TEXT. ALL THE LOREM IPSUM</p>
