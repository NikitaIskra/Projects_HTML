    <header class="text"><p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.<br>
        <br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from<br>
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web<br>
pages HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically<br>
and originally included cues for the appearance of the document<br>
<br>
HTML, elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML<br>
constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms<br>
may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML, provides a<br>
means to create structured documents by denoting structural<br>
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes<br>
and other items HTML, elements are delineated by togs, written<br>
using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly<br>
introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround<br>
and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML<br>
tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p></header>

<header class="text"><p>HTML, markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),<br>
     character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in<br>
      pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example<br>
     &lt;img&gt;.The first tag in such a palis the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening<br>
      tags and closing tags).
      <br>
      Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode<br>
      rendering.<br>
